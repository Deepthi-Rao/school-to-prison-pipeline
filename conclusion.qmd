# Conclusion

Across the analyses completed there are several broad takeaways that can speak directly to the school to prison pipeline. States across the United States vary considerably in their overall rates of disciplinary measures, and notable regional and racial patterns appear. Students seem to experience differing levels of disciplinary measures across right and left leaning states, with particularly more harsh outcomes for students of color. Referrals to law enforcement appear to show less pronounced regional patterns and appear to be quite low across the country except for a few hot spots.Together, the visual and statistical results suggest that disciplinary practices could be shaped by underlying state level contexts such as the political and cultural climate of the state.

There are many additional directions that this data could be further studied to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the school to prison pipeline landscape. Future analysis could explore how these patterns have shifted overtime, or how local policies and school characteristics influence disciplinary trends. Bringing in additional information such as resource allocation, demographic information, and test scores could offer a more detailed understanding of what drives these patterns. By increasing the scope in this way, we can gain a more complete picture of the factors that shape the school to prison pipeline.
