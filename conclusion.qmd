# Conclusion

Looking across the country, the data was converted from raw discipline counts into rates per student so that big and small states could be fairly compared. Most states cluster at relatively low levels of suspensions, expulsions, and other punishments, but a smaller group of states especially in the South, like Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Louisiana, and Alabama use formal discipline much more often. 

When the discipline map is placed next to the 2020 election map, a strong pattern emerges. States that vote more conservatively are also the ones that use school discipline more aggressively, while many liberal leaning states have lower discipline rates. A scatterplot helps to show this correlation visually. This does not prove that political leanings directly affect discipline rates, but it suggests that broader political and cultural attitudes about punishment and “law and order” show up inside schools as well.

The racial breakdown deepens this picture. Native American, Black, and multiracial students are disciplined at notably higher rates than their peers in many states. Places like Arkansas stand out as especially harsh across almost every racial group. When we look specifically at referrals to law enforcement and school-based arrests classic entry points into the juvenile justice system—most states use them rarely, but a few such as South Dakota and Wyoming rely on them much more. Taken together, these findings show the trends that help to define the school to prison pipeline.
