# Introduction

The school-to-prison pipeline refers to a set of policies and practices in U.S. school systems that disproportionately push underserved students, especially students of color, out of classrooms and toward the juvenile and criminal justice systems. The pipeline is rooted in our nation’s long history of segregation, inequality, and inequity; it is then reinforced today by disciplinary practices such as frequent suspensions and expulsions for low grade offenses. In this project, I will study the trends that create this pipeline with a focus on racial disparities and regional patterns. Specifically, I will analyze how rates of suspensions, expulsions, involvement of law enforcement, and arrests vary by race, geographic location and political leaning.
